# What are Image Processing and Computer Vision?

## Image Processing

Image processing focuses on manipulating images, improving them, transforming them, or extracting basic information.

Think of it as mathematical operations on images.

Examples:

-   Enhancing brightness/contrast
    
-   Noise removal
    
-   Blurring/sharpening
    
-   Edge detection (Sobel, Canny)
    
-   Converting RGB → grayscale
    
-   Image compression
    
-   Filtering (Gaussian, median)  

Goal: Make the image better, cleaner, or ready for further analysis.

## Computer Vision

Computer vision focuses on making machines understand images the way humans do.

It’s about recognition, detection, and interpretation extracting high-level semantic meaning.

Examples:

-   Detecting objects in an image (cars, people, cats)
    
-   Identifying a person’s face
    
-   Recognizing text (OCR)
    
-   Understanding scene depth
    
-   Tracking objects in video
    
-   Segmenting objects pixel-by-pixel
    
-   Reconstructing 3D structure from 2D images

Goal: Let computers interpret and make decisions based on images.
