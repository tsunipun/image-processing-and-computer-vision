# Key applications: enhancement, detection, segmentation, generation

## 1. Enhancement (Improving Image Quality)

Techniques that refine or restore images.

### Common Applications

-   Denoising – Remove noise from low-light or low-quality images.  
      
    
-   Super-resolution – Upscale images while preserving details (e.g., ESRGAN).  
      
    
-   Sharpening / Deblurring – Fix motion blur and out-of-focus images.  
      
    
-   Color correction & grading – Enhance visual aesthetics, used heavily in photography and film.  
      
    
-   Restoration – Recover old/damaged photos, remove scratches, restore missing parts.  
      
    
-   HDR imaging – Combine exposures to create high-dynamic-range images.  
      
    
-   Retouching pipelines – Skin smoothing, toning, artifact removal (mobile cameras).

## 2. Detection (Finding & Identifying Objects/Patterns)

Systems that locate and classify regions of interest.

### Common Applications

-   Object detection – Detect people, vehicles, products (YOLO, Faster R-CNN).  
      
    
-   Face detection & recognition – Phones, CCTV, access control.  
      
    
-   Pose estimation – Human pose, body landmarks, hand tracking (OpenPose, MediaPipe).  
      
    
-   Edge & feature detection – Find boundaries and shapes, used in robotics & mapping.  
      
    
-   Anomaly detection – Identify defects in manufacturing or irregularities in medical images.  
      
    
-   Text detection (OCR) – Reading documents, license plates, receipts, translation apps.  
      
    
-   Scene understanding – Detecting multiple objects for AR, self-driving, robotics.

## 3. Segmentation (Understanding Image Regions)

Assigning a pixel-wise label to every part of an image.

### Common Applications

-   Semantic segmentation – Understanding each pixel (road, tree, car, sky).  
      
    
-   Instance segmentation – Distinguish separate objects of the same class (e.g., Mask R-CNN).  
      
    
-   Medical segmentation – Tumors, organs, lesions, vessels (MRI/CT analysis).  
      
    
-   Background removal – Portrait mode, image editing, product photography.  
      
    
-   Matting / alpha extraction – Fine-grained segmentation for hair, smoke, transparency.  
      
    
-   Autonomous driving – Lane detection, drivable area, pedestrian segmentation.  
      
    
-   Agriculture – Plant/leaf segmentation, crop disease detection.

## 4. Generation (Creating New Images or Modifying Existing Ones)

AI-driven creation and transformation of visuals.

### Common Applications

-   Text-to-image generation – Stable Diffusion, DALL·E, Midjourney.  
      
    
-   Image-to-image transformation – Style transfer, colorization, super-resolution.  
      
    
-   Editing & inpainting – Removing objects, filling missing content.  
      
    
-   Avatar and art generation – AI avatars, cartoons, digital art.  
      
    
-   Video generation – Motion synthesis, video diffusion models.  
      
    
-   3D/NeRF generation – 3D scene reconstruction from images.  
      
    
-   Synthetic dataset generation – For training ML models when real data is limited.
